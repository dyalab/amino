Tutorial {#tutorial}
========

Current work in progress.

This tutorial introduces the key concepts and programming abstractions
in Amino.

Example code for the tutorials is located in the amino source tree
under `./demo/tutorial/`.

Please [install](@ref installation) Amino prior to running the example
code in the tutorials.

1. [Linear Algebra](@ref tutorial_la)
2. [Rotation](@ref tutorial_rot)
3. [Transformation](@ref tutorial_tf)
4. [Scene Graphs](@ref tutorial_scene)
5. [Kinematics](@ref tutorial_kin)
6. [Collision](@ref tutorial_col)
7. [Motion Planning](@ref tutorial_mp)



Prerequisite Knowledge
---------------------

This tutorial is aimed at readers with at least an undergraduate
junior-level knowledge in computing or engineering.  Specifically, the
following knowledge is assumed:

* Basic programming and data structures
* C and Python programming languages
* Basic Linear Algebra (vectors and matrices)
* Calculus-based physics (mechanics)
* Basic understanding of partial differential equations

Additionally, this tutorial introduces topics in robot mechanics and
kinematics.  The reader may also find it helpful to read or review
additional resources on topics to obtain further mathematical details.
References are listed at the end of each tutorial section.
